	How it works
Five second tests help you understand people’s first impressions of your designs.
By finding out what a person recalls about your design in just 5 seconds you can ensure that your message is 
being communicated as effectively as possible.

    “Fivesecondtest could easily get addictive. With so much UI feedback available so cheaply, you could 
try a much riskier UI & iterate.”
