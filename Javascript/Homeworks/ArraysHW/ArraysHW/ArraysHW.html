    <ol>
        <li>
            Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5. Print the obtained array on the console.
        </li>
        <li>
            Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
        </li>
        <li>
            Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
            Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1}  {2, 2, 2}.
        </li>
        <li>
            Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array. Example: {3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4}  {2, 3, 4}.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a script to sort an array. Use the "selection sort" algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.Hint: Use a second array
        </li>
        <li>
            Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array. Example:
            {4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3}  4 (5 times)
        </li>
        <li>
            Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the binary search algorithm (find it in Wikipedia)
        </li>
    </ol>
