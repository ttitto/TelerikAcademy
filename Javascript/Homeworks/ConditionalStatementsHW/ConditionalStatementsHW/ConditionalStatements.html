            <li>
                Write an if statement that examines two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a script that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a sequence of if statements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a script that finds the biggest of three integers using nested if statements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested if statements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write script that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a switch statement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a script that enters the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation
                a*x2 + b*x + c = 0
                and calculates and prints its real roots. Note that quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a script that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a script that converts a number in the range [0...999] to a text corresponding to its English pronunciation. Examples:
                0  "Zero"
                273  "Two hundred seventy three"
                400  "Four hundred"
                501  "Five hundred and one"
                711  "Seven hundred and eleven"
