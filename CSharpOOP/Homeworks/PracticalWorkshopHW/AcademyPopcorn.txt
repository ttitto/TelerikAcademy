1.The AcademyPopcorn class contains an IndestructibleBlock class. Use it to create side and ceiling walls to the game. You can ONLY edit the AcademyPopcornMain.cs file.
2. The Engine class has a hardcoded sleep time (search for "System.Threading.Sleep(500)". Make the sleep time a field in the Engine and implement a constructor, which takes it as an additional parameter.
3. Search for a "TODO" in the Engine class, regarding the AddRacket method. Solve the problem mentioned there. There should always be only one Racket. Note: comment in TODO not completely correct
4 Inherit the Engine class. Create a method ShootPlayerRacket. Leave it empty for now.
5. Implement a TrailObject class. It should inherit the GameObject class and should have a constructor which takes an additional "lifetime" integer. The TrailObject should disappear after a "lifetime" amount of turns. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file. Then test the TrailObject by adding an instance of it in the engine through the AcademyPopcornMain.cs file.
6. Implement a MeteoriteBall. It should inherit the Ball class and should leave a trail of TrailObject objects. Each trail objects should last for 3 "turns". Other than that, the Meteorite ball should behave the same way as the normal ball. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file.
7. Test the MeteoriteBall by replacing the normal ball in the AcademyPopcornMain.cs file.
8. Implement an UnstoppableBall and an UnpassableBlock. The UnstopableBall only bounces off UnpassableBlocks and will destroy any other block it passes through. The UnpassableBlock should be indestructible. Hint: Take a look at the RespondToCollision method, the GetCollisionGroupString method and the CollisionData class.
9. Test the UnpassableBlock and the UnstoppableBall by adding them to the engine in AcademyPopcornMain.cs file
10. Implement an ExplodingBlock. It should destroy all blocks around it when it is destroyed. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file. Hint: what does an explosion "produce"?
11. Implement a Gift class. It should be a moving object, which always falls down. The gift shouldn't collide with any ball, but should collide (and be destroyed) with the racket. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file. 
12. Implement a GiftBlock class. It should be a block, which "drops" a Gift object when it is destroyed. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file. Test the Gift and GiftBlock classes by adding them through the AcademyPopcornMain.cs file.
